2013 Light-O-Rama Sequences
I "think" there are 8 LOR controllers being used (128-channels), but not all those channels are being used.
The tree line has 2 sets of colors (red and white)
Only pixels in this configuration is the 100 CCBs on the Cactus

Disclaimers:
* Quality varies: These sequences are from my 2nd year of doing a LOR show so the quality of the sequencing will vary.
* Music: I don't share music. In some cases I edit down the song with Audacity. For these songs I haven't gone back to reproduce the edits so you may need to pull it up in Audacity and reverse engineer the edits. I've heard some people google how to convert a youtube to mp3, but I don't know anything about that and would not recommend that as an efficient way to get the audio track after you have purchased the full music track.
* Old: I haven't used the LOR S4 sequencer in years.
